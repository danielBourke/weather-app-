# A Millions Ads Frontend Tech Test
This repo contains a mock API server for you to develop a frontend UI, using the framework of your choice. We know your time is precious, so we strongly suggest that you use boilerplate such as `create-react-app` or `vue create` and spend your time solving the brief rather than setting up your environment.

## Your task is:
Fork or clone this repo and...
1. create a frontend app with an input field that accepts a postcode
2. call the provided API to retrieve the weather data for the given postcode
3. display this information in your app - use your imagination and be creative

Please complete as much of the task as you can in a 2 hour timeframe. We're not expecting you to return a completely finished project, but you should be prepared to talk about the choices you've made. We'd like to see your Git commit history to understand how you've built up your solution, so please be sure to make commits as you go along.

## Installation
Fork or clone this repo and run `npm install`.

## Getting Started
`npm run api` will give you a local API providing limited information about locations and weather.

As described above, you should add your own choice of frontend framework. We use Vue and TypeScript and we'd love to see you use those if you're already familiar with them, but if not please choose whatever helps you to display your skills most effectively.
